A repository of my experience in the fall 20025 Cyber Skyline National Cyber League (NCL).
The NCL is a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) events. While not my first time competing, the NCL is always an exciting set of challenges. The NCL has given me a better understanding of my skills and where I need to improve. Each time the challenges are different, allowing me to stretch some new skills.  Overall, I have successfully ranked in the top 2 percent of competitors.
•	99th percentile; Forensics, Log Analysis, Network Traffic Analysis, Password Cracking
•	98th percentile; Cryptography, Enumeration & Exploitation, Web Application Exploitation
