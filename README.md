>I found my love of cybersecurity through an NSA scholarship for active-duty Soldiers.
I discovered that my lifelong interest in technology and computers revealed an aptitude I was unaware of.
<br>

  My preparation strategy leveraged multiple resources to ensure I was ready for both the individual and team competitions. I watched SANS videos on Canvas and studied content from the NCL YouTube channel to refresh my technical skills. Competing, I had a clear plan: read every question thoroughly, review every provided document carefully, and maintain an organized track of my progress. This methodical approach proved effective, and I largely stuck to my strategy throughout the competition.
<br>

This competition reinforced skills I had developed over time and boosted my confidence for future cybersecurity work.  The experience reaffirmed that I feel better prepared to conduct cybersecurity work in the future.<br>

The NCL is a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) events. While not my first time competing, the NCL is always an exciting set of challenges. The NCL has given me a better understanding of my skills and where I need to improve. Each time the challenges are different, allowing me to stretch some new skills.  Overall, I have successfully ranked in the top 2 percent of competitors.<br>
  -  **99th percentile**; Forensics, Log Analysis, Network Traffic Analysis, Password Cracking
  -  **98th percentile**; Cryptography, Enumeration & Exploitation, Web Application Exploitation
